Network Analysis and Ricardian Comparative advantage (Costinot et al. 2012)
In this folder I saved R code and stata code I used to estimate an theoretical motivated Ricardian Comparative Advantage measure.
The R code creates the dataset from the OECD Databases , TiVA, ANBRED and STAN. 
The Stata code describes the estimation of the trade elasticity and the dummy regressions to obtain the country, industry fixed effect.
The theoretical motivated Ricardian Comparative Advantage measure is than e to the power of the fixed effect divided by the trade price elasticity. 
Further I normalize the measure relative to a reference country and reference industry.
