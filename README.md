Network Analysis and Structural Ricardian Comparative advantage (Costinot et al. 2012)
In this folder I saved R code and stata code I used to estimate an theoretical motivated Ricardian Comparative Advantage measure.
The R code describes the creation of the final data set from the raw data from the OECD Databases TiVA, ANBRED and STAN. 
The Stata code describes the estimation of the trade elasticity and the dummy regressions to obtain the country, industry fixed effect. This fixed effect can be used to obtain a model consistent measure for RCA.
